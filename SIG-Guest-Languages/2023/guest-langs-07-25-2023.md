## Updates

* Guy Bedford: Wasi-Virt is now virtualizing environment and file-system stuff (as discussed on the community stream this morning, there's a demo there also). The project is at a point where it'd be nice to see how people want to use it.
* Brett Cannon: I did get threading support into Python 3.12 which is going to hit rc1 next week. I'm hoping it will continue to support that.

## Agenda
